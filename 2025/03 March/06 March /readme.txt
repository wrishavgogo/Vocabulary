Today i learnt a new word : Idempotent 

what is means ? 

Idempotent means that result produced by doing the action once and doing the action multiple times are same . 

Sentence : 

Tapping your id card against the scanner is idempotent , as tapping it once opens the door you dont need to do it multiple times 

My thoughts : 

Yeah i know i know idempotent can be exchangibly used with Redundant as well
